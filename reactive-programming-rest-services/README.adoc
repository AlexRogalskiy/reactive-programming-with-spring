= Spring Reactive framework with Rest Services

This is just a simple implementation on how we can use spring reactive framework to make calls to
a server with REST resources.

In this exploration, we implemented reactive webclient, with a reactive handler to handle requests sent
from the webclient.

We also explored how we could use flux to create a stream in input values and have the error channel,
the data channel (subscribe channel) and onComplete channel implemented as a handler.
